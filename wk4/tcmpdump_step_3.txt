To limit the number of packets captured, you can use the `-c` option in **`tcpdump`**. This option specifies the number of packets to capture before stopping the capture.

### Example:

```
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 tcp -c 100
```

### Explanation:
- **`-c 100`**: This tells `tcpdump` to capture only 100 packets.
- **`-i eth0`**: Captures packets from the network interface `eth0`.
- **`tcp`**: Captures only TCP packets.

Once 100 TCP packets are captured, `tcpdump` will stop automatically.

### Other Useful Options:
- **`-w`**: To write the captured packets to a file (useful for later analysis).
  Example: `sudo tcpdump -i eth0 tcp -c 100 -w capture.pcap`

- **`-v` or `-vv` or `-vvv`**: To increase the verbosity of the output.

- **`-n`**: To avoid resolving hostnames and show IP addresses instead (faster).
