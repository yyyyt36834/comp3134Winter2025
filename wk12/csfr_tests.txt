What I have noticed:

1. csfr.php does not check whehter or not the form is submitted on csfr.php. It leads to accepting any form submission to csfr.php including such case that an attacker tricks a legitimate user to 
load a html file containing a hidden form with the user credentials that are taken and let the user submit the form without them knowing it happening.

2. In csfr_form.php and csfr_action.php, the token is created in csfr_form.php and include that token in the submission and the session, making it difficult to forge the submission by pretending to be the legitimate user 
because the legitimate form request includes a valid token, and the token will be checked before the request gets processed.
