What is the difference between stripping tags and displaying the html entity value of any user input?

The both ways mitigate the risk of malicious users trying to make the webpage execute tha task that is not intended.
The difference is as follows.

- Stripping tags will show the input without the tags. For example, if a user types in <script>hello</scirpt>,
  it will take the <script></script> part of the input.

- Displaying the html entity value of any user input will show the whole input. If a user types in <script>hello</scirpt>,
  it will display <script>hello</scirpt> as input.
