• Should not be able to view files and folders before html directory

	Use basename() function to strip the last part of the url. It prevents users to enter url such as  /../../ to see the 
	directories above html.

• Should not attempt to look at folders that do not exists

	use file_exists() to check if the file is actually exists in the directory.
